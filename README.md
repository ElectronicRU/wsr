wsr -- Webbrowser Shell resources
=================================

wsr is a bunch of utilities that help in automated web browsing.
Present features include:
* cookies;
* history (with referers);
* encoding detection.
Coming soon:
* form-filling aids;
* information extraction helpers.
For running, curl is necessary. For building, you may want to have
C compiler and, optionally, Python 2.x; this is not required, but toggles
better encoding detection.
